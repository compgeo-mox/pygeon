class MortarGrid(pp.MortarGrid):
    """
    A class representing a mortar grid, which is used for the discretization of
    interfaces between subdomains in a numerical simulation.

    Attributes:
        cell_faces (scipy.sparse.csc_array): The connectivity between cells of the
            secondary grid and faces of the primary grid.
        face_ridges (scipy.sparse.csc_array): The connectivities between high-dimensional
            ridges and low-dimensional faces in the mortar grid.
        ridge_peaks (scipy.sparse.csc_array): The connectivities between high-dimensional
            peaks and low-dimensional ridges in the mortar grid.
        signed_mortar_to_primary (scipy.sparse.csc_array): The mapping from mortar cells
            to the faces of the primary grid that respects orientation.

    Methods:
        __init__(*args, **kwargs):
            Initialize a new instance of the MortarGrid class.

        compute_geometry(sd_pair):
            Computes the geometry of the MortarGrid.

        compute_ridges(sd_pair):
            Assign the face-ridge and ridge-peak connectivities to the mortar grid.

        assign_signed_mortar_to_primary(sd_pair):
            Compute the mapping from mortar cells to the faces of the primary grid that
            respects orientation.

            Assign the connectivity between cells of the secondary grid and faces of the
            primary grid.
