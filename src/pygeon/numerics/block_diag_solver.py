    Assembles the block-wise inverse of a sparse matrix based on connected components.

    This function computes the inverse of a sparse matrix M by dividing it into
    submatrices corresponding to connected components. Each submatrix is inverted

    Notes:
        - The function uses the connected components of the graph represented by M
          to determine the blocks for inversion.
        - The inversion is performed using dense matrix operations for each block,
          which may be computationally expensive for large blocks.
